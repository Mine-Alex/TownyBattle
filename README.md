Now that all Release builds and Development builds are being made available here on github's [Releases](https://github.com/Mine-Alex/TownyBattle/releases) tab I am recommending that server admins "watch" Towny Battle on github. Just click the watch button in the upper right and select "Custom > Releases".
    
Alternatively, if you [watch the resource](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/townybattle.101931/) on Spigot you will be notified on that website when a new Release version is out.
